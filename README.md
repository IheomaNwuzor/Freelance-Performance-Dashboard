# FreelancerGig and Job Earnings Performance Dashboard

## Background 

FreelanceGig Analytics is a data-driven company focused on analysing trends in the gig economy. The company provides insights into freelancer earnings, job success rates, and market trends across various platforms. By analysing freelancer performance and earnings, FreelanceGig Analytics helps businesses, freelancers, and policymakers make informed decisions. The Gig economy is growing rapidly, with freelancers working across various platforms. However, freelancers and clients often struggle to predict earnings, job success rates, and demand for certain skills, which affects business efficiency. FreelanceGig Analytics seeks to provide data-driven insights into freelancer performance, earnings, and success factors. This project builds interactive dashboards using Tableau that transform raw freelance data into meaningful insights for freelancers, clients, and policymakers.

## Problem Statement
Freelancers and clients lack clear visibility into key performance metrics in the gig economy. Specifically:
•	What freelance categories and platforms offer the highest earning potential?
•	How do experience levels and job categories influence hourly rates?
•	Which platforms provide the best success rates for freelancers?
•	Can freelancer earnings be forecasted to help with planning and career decisions?
The project aims to solve these questions by developing visual, interactive Tableau dashboards for exploration and forecasting.

## Current Challenges

Business Challenges

1.	Earnings Uncertainty
o	Freelancers struggle to predict earnings across job categories and platforms.
2.	Platform Performance Comparison
o	Success rates vary widely across platforms with little transparency.
3.	Experience-Level Impact
o	Beginners, intermediates, and experts earn differently, but trends are not clear.
4.	Client Retention Visibility
o	Limited insights into client satisfaction, ratings, and rehire rates.

## Data Challenges

1.	Fragmented Data: Freelancer details and job/earnings data are split across separate tables.
2.	Inconsistent data types and formatting with appropriate identifiers.
3.	Complex Relationships: Inability to analyse multiple metrics together.
4.	Forecasting Needs: Traditional static reporting does not enable predictive analysis of earnings trends.

## Aim

To design and implement an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides actionable insights into freelancer performance, earnings, and job success, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.

## Objectives

•	Analyse freelancer job trends 
•	Assess freelancer earnings
•	Identify key success factors
•	Forecast freelancer earnings 
•	Develop interactive dashboards
•	Offer Recommendations

## Detailed Steps 

•	Data Sourcing and Preparation:

o	Dataset cleaning and formatting.

o	Data importation, table joining (Freelancer details and job earnings data).

o	Proper data assignment (numerical, categorical, date).

•	Creating calculated Fields for KPIs, Metrics & visualisations

•	Visualisation Creation

•	Dashboard Development

•	Data analysis and Forecasting

•	Recommendations

## Technical Highlights

• KPI Cards: Created using calculated fields and fixed LOD expressions to ensure consistent metrics across filters.

• Parameter Controls: Facilitates interactive comparisons of hourly rates by experience level.

• Heatmap Matrix: Visualises platform earnings by experience, making it straightforward to identify earning potential across levels.

• Custom Icons & Branding: Incorporates design elements such as platform-themed visuals for a professional, portfolio-ready appearance.

• Colour Palette: Uses a consistent purple-pink theme to distinguish from the ER dashboard whilst improving readability.

## Conclusion

This project provides comprehensive gig economy insights by combining freelancer details with job and earnings data. The FreelanceGig Dashboard turns fragmented gig economy data into a clear, actionable story with the KPIs which Freelancers and policymakers can use to benchmark themselves against industry averages, find growth opportunities, and adjust rates strategically. Platform managers can leverage these insights and recommendations to optimise freelancer placement, enhance client satisfaction, and improve overall ecosystem efficiency.
