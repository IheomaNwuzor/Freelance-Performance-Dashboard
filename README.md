# Introduction
The FreelanceGig Dashboard provides an interactive, analytical view of freelancer performance, client engagement, and earnings across various platforms and job categories. It was designed to help freelancers and platform managers monitor success rates, client satisfaction, rehire likelihood, and earning potential in a competitive gig economy. 

# Rationale
The freelancing sector relies heavily on data-driven decisions, where both freelancers and hiring platforms need clarity on performance trends. For freelancers, tracking earnings and client ratings is crucial for improving service delivery. For platforms, insights into rehire rates and success by category enable better alignment of supply and demand. This dashboard unites these elements in a visually compelling manner.

# Deliverable
The dashboard features:
• Performance Metrics: Job success rate, client ratings, rehire rate, and average earnings.
• Category Insights: Earnings breakdown by sectors such as design, development, and marketing.
• Experience-Based Analysis: Hourly rate comparisons for beginner, intermediate, and expert freelancers.
• Platform Comparison: Job success and earning distribution across platforms like Fiverr, Freelancer, Toptal, PeoplePerHour, and Upwork.

# Technical Highlights

• KPI Cards: Created using calculated fields and fixed LOD expressions to ensure consistent metrics across filters.
• Parameter Controls: Facilitates interactive comparisons of hourly rates by experience level.
• Heatmap Matrix: Visualises platform earnings by experience, making it straightforward to identify earning potential across levels.
• Custom Icons & Branding: Incorporates design elements such as platform-themed visuals for a professional, portfolio-ready appearance.
• Colour Palette: Uses a consistent purple-pink theme to distinguish from the ER dashboard whilst improving readability.

# Conclusions
The FreelanceGig Dashboard turns fragmented gig economy data into a clear, actionable story. Freelancers can use it to benchmark themselves against industry averages, find growth opportunities, and adjust rates strategically. Platform managers can leverage these insights to optimise freelancer placement, enhance client satisfaction, and improve overall ecosystem efficiency.
